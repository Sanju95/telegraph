		"content": "If you're usually office-bound, Christmas is the perfect time to take advantage of the pleasures of a daytime nap. For those like me, who work from home, taking a nap whenever you like is one of the few things that makes home working worthwhile, alongside the short commute, 'relaxed' dress code and colleagues not sidling up to your desk and asking if they can 'borrow you for a minute?'. And let me tell you, I'm very, very good at napping. For me, a daytime nap is one of the most civilised distractions ever invented."
